# Front-End-Developer-Capstone
Booking a table on the Little Lemon website

Final capstone project for Meta Front-end developer program on Coursera, which contains a detailed and responsive website with table-booking functionality built using React.

The home page includes the resturant's logo, a navigation bar, a promotion section, few articles and a footer. The page looks lively with the help of CSS animations and effects.
